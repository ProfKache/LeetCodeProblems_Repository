## About The Project
All algorithms implemented in JavaScript.
There implementations are for learning purposes. If you want to contribute more efficient solutions feel free to open an issue and commit your solution.


## Issues
To contribute check the Issues. After Coding you can check your Code for correct Results at [LeetCode Algorithms](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) 

To contribute make sure the Algorithm isn't commited yet! PRs with Algorithms already in the Repo will be closed.
Make sure to add the number of the Issue in your PR.

## Naming
Please make sure your file is named correctly: `LeetCodeNr_AlgorithmName.js` -> eg. `001_TwoSum.js` or `437_PathSum3.js`
